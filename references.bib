Teams of {AUVs} designed to work within a common mission are opening the possibilities for new and more complex applications. In underwater environments, communication, localization, and navigation of {AUVs} are considered challenges due to the impossibility of relying on radio communications and global positioning systems. For a long time, acoustic systems have been the main approach for solving these challenges. However, they present their own shortcomings, which are more relevant for {AUV} teams. As a result, researchers have explored different alternatives. To summarize and analyze these alternatives, a review of the literature is presented in this paper. Finally, a summary of collaborative {AUV} teams and missions is also included, with the aim of analyzing their applicability, advantages, and limitations.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05516},
	shorttitle = {{EROAS}},
	abstract = {Advances in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles ({AUVs}) have evolved vastly in short period of time. While advancements in sonar and camera technology with deep learning aid the obstacle detection and path planning to a great extent, achieving the right balance between computational resources , precision and safety maintained remains a challenge. Finding optimal solutions for real-time navigation in cluttered environments becomes pivotal as systems have to process large amounts of data efficiently. In this work, we propose a novel obstacle avoidance method for navigating 3D underwater environments. This approach utilizes a standard multibeam forward-looking sonar to detect and map obstacle in 3D environment. Instead of using computationally expensive 3D sensors, we pivot the 2D sonar to get 3D heuristic data effectively transforming the sensor into a 2.5D sonar for real-time 3D navigation decisions. This approach enhances obstacle detection and navigation by leveraging the simplicity of 2D sonar with the depth perception typically associated with 3D systems. We have further incorporated Control Barrier Function ({CBF}) as a filter to ensure safety of the {AUV}. The effectiveness of this algorithm was tested on a six degrees of freedom ({DOF}) rover in various simulation scenarios. The results demonstrate that the system successfully avoids obstacles and navigates toward predefined goals, showcasing its capability to manage complex underwater environments with precision. This paper highlights the potential of 2.5D sonar for improving {AUV} navigation and offers insights into future enhancements and applications of this technology in underwater autonomous systems. {\textbackslash}url\{https://github.com/{AIRLabIISc}/{EROAS}\}},

	abstract = {In the past decades, drag-reduction surfaces have attracted more and more attention due to their potentiality and wide applications in various fields such as traffic, energy transportation, agriculture, textile industry, and military. However, there are still some drag-reduction materials that need to be deeply explored. Fortunately, natural creatures always have the best properties after long-term evolution; aquatic organisms have diversified surface microstructures and drag-reducing materials, which provide design templates for the development of thriving artificial underwater drag-reduction materials. Aquatic animals are tamed by the current while fighting against the water, and thus have excellent drag reduction that is unparalleled in water. Inspired by biological principles, using aquatic animals as a bionic object to develop and reduce frictional resistance in fluids has attracted more attention in the past few years. More and more aquatic animals bring new inspiration for drag-reduction surfaces and a tremendous amount of research effort has been put into the study of surface drag-reduction, with an aim to seek the surface structure with the best drag-reduction effect and explore the drag-reduction mechanism. This present paper reviews the research on drag-reduction surfaces inspired by aquatic animals, including sharks, dolphins, and other aquatic animals. Aquatic animals as bionic objects are described in detail, with a discussion on the drag-reduction mechanism and drag-reduction effect to understand the development of underwater drag-reduction fully. In bionic manufacturing, the effective combination of various preparation methods is summarized. Moreover, bionic surfaces are briefly explained in terms of traffic, energy sources, sports, and agriculture. In the end, both existing problems in bionic research and future research prospects are proposed. This paper may provide a better and more comprehensive understanding of the current research status of aquatic animals-inspired drag reduction.},

	abstract = {The Oceanographic Systems Laboratory of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution has developed the {REMUS} 600, a new 12.75 inch (32.385 cm) diameter autonomous underwater vehicle that will be used to carry mine countermeasures sensors for the Office of Naval Research. Vehicle Control Technologies has been tasked by {ONR} to develop autopilot and simulation software for several {REMUS} 600 sensor configurations, with the objective of achieving enhanced platform steadiness to improve sensor performance in the shallow water and very shallow water environment. The most stringent motion steadiness requirements for the {REMUS} 600 vehicle are derived from the image forming specifications of a new side-looking synthetic aperture sonar developed for {ONR} by the Penn State Applied Physics Laboratory and the Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida. This payload necessitated the use of a forward fin section for enhanced control authority. This forward fin section gives the vehicle the ability to command vertical and horizontal sideslips, in addition to roll, pitch, and yaw control, using independently commanded fins. This is a unique capability for a vehicle of this class. In addition, the 12.75 inch diameter vehicle class offers new capabilities for endurance and payload capacity. The {REMUS} 600 software architecture has been designed with the flexibility to accommodate various payloads and both the {VCT} autopilot and the Woods Hole autopilot. We present the {VCT} approach to autopilot design which makes use of a high-fidelity hydrodynamics model, software in the loop simulation test, vehicle motion steadiness performance predictions, and post-test validation. The {REMUS} 600 vehicle has collected extensive in-water data. We present performance results based on this data},

	abstract = {A new generation of autonomous underwater vehicles are being successfully utilized to support a number of scientific and military objectives. Despite their small size and low cost, these new vehicles are versatile, reliable and require only a two person support staff. These features make the vehicles affordable and available for use by a broad segment of the oceanographic community. The vehicle operators must be confident that they can cost effectively use these new tools with a minimum of support staff for missions such as coastal ocean surveys, and pollution identification and source tracking. An effort to design and fabricate a low cost, small, and accessible vehicle resulted in {REMUS}, Remote Environmental Measuring {UnitS}. The vehicle is 19 cm in diameter by 134 cm long and weighs 31 kg. It has an operating and control system based on the {PC}-104 form factor of the {IBM}-{PC} which can be connected to a laptop computer for system configuration. With 400 watt-hours of conventional lead acid batteries the vehicle has a useful range of 25 nautical miles at 3 knots, and a top speed of 5 knots. {REMUS} is capable of navigating itself using a variety of techniques including long and ultra-short baseline acoustic navigation, bottomlock Doppler navigation and {GPS} reception. The major system design features are described in this paper including the electrical power plant, the vehicle control system, the acoustic navigation system, and the user interface to the vehicle. The mechanical design and system performance are presented along with recent results from field tests of navigating the vehicle around a pair of transponders.},

In this edition of the Nessie {AUV} family, the platform has undertaken a signiﬁcant upgrade from the Nessie V vehicle both in hardware and software levels. In terms of mechanical design, the new design was done by an {MEng} Student of the mechanical engineering department and implemented by student of the Ocean Systems Laboratory. In terms of software, the Robotic Operating System ({ROS}) from Willow Garage has been adopted and all existing code has been ported to this new middleware supporting layer. This has proven very beneﬁcial enabling better debugging and replay capabilities as well as added functionalities such as on-board camera calibration. The robotic platform is equipped with state-of-the-art sensors, providing both the vehicle internal state such as position, speed and orientation as well as situation awareness (position of targets, and obstacles, mission goals). Using a robust hardware and software design the vehicle is ready to compete at this year competition, as well as being an excellent platform for research activities in the University. This paper describes the new vehicle hardware design and the novel software algorithms implemented to perform the different task challenges of the competition.},

In the present work, based on the hydrodynamic characteristics with different shape features of {UVs}, the hull shape genealogy including the spherical/spheroidal shape, slender axisymmetric shape, slender flat shape and round-dish shape was established according to the genealogy classification theory. Influence of the hull shape parameters and Reynolds numbers on hydrodynamics of the spherical/spheroidal shape, slender axisymmetric shape and slender flat shape for wide application in hull shape genealogy was investigated by using computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}) simulation method. The mathematical models of the drag coefficients of the hull shape genealogy with different shape parameters and Reynolds numbers were established by fitting the data obtained from {CFD} calculation. The accuracy of the established drag coefficient models was verified by the tank tests of “Petrel-L″ model developed by Tianjin University and {SUBOFF} model. Furthermore, the established drag coefficient models show higher accuracy than the traditional drag coefficient models, namely G\&J model, {VT} model and {MIT} model, by comparing with the towing tank tests of {SUBOFF} model. The present research provides an important reference for realizing the rapid and efficient design of {UVs} with the same hydrodynamic shapes.},

	abstract = {Design optimization of an unmanned underwater vehicle ({UUV}) is a complex and a computationally expensive exercise that requires the identification of optimal vehicle dimensions offering the best tradeoffs between the objectives, while satisfying the set of design constraints. Although hull form optimization of marine vessels has long been an active area of research, limited attempts in the past have focused on the design optimization of {UUVs} and there are even fewer reports on the use of high-fidelity analysis methods within the course of optimization. While it is understood that the high-fidelity analysis is more accurate, they also tend to be far more computationally expensive. Thus, it is important to identify when a high-fidelity analysis is required as opposed to a low-fidelity estimate. The work reported in this paper is an extension of the authors previous work of a design optimization framework, where the design problem was solved using a low-fidelity model based on empirical estimates of drag. In this paper, the framework is extended to deal with high-fidelity estimates derived through seamless integration of computer-aided design, meshing and computational fluid dynamics analysis tools i.e., computer aided 3-D interactive application, {ICEM}, and {FLUENT}. The effects of using low-fidelity and high-fidelity analyses are studied in depth using a small-scale (length nominally less than 400 mm) and light-weight (less than 450 g) toy submarine. Useful insights on possible means to identify appropriateness of fidelity models via correlation measures are proposed. The term optimality used in this paper refers to optimal hull form shapes that satisfy placement of a set of prescribed internal components.},

To perform these tasks accurately in the deep-sea environment, stable motion control has become a key area of research on {ROV} systems, which has led to the importance of analyzing the hydrodynamic characteristic of {ROVs}. But a systematic methodology for analyzing the hydrodynamic characteristics of {ROVs} is still lacking nowadays. In this paper, systematic numerical simulation methods for analyzing hydrodynamic characteristics and shape optimization of a work-class {ROV} are conducted, and details of simulation procedures based on computational fluid dynamics are studied, which can be a foundation for robust controller design.},

	abstract = {Shallow Water Inspection \& Monitoring Robot ({SWIM}-R) is designed to quickly and safely inspect oil and gas pipelines in extremely shallow waters. Divers clean and inspect pipeline joints. However, diving operations are slow in shallow waters as diving support ships cannot access shallow depths. Remotely operated vehicles ({ROVs}) that can perform cleaning and inspection are typically suited for deeper regions and are too large for smaller boats that navigate in shallow areas. To resolve this challenge, two {SWIM}-R vehicles and a companion Autonomous Surface Vehicle ({ASV}) were developed as a multi-robot system to minimize the reliance on divers for pipeline inspection. A unique mission architecture is presented that avails three operating modes depending on the depth; direct control from the shore, relayed control via the {ASV}, and direct control from a small zodiac. The mission architecture includes two {ROVs}; a Cleaning {SWIM}-R fitted with a water-jet nozzle to clean marine growth from the surface to be inspected, and an Inspection {SWIM}-R fitted with a neutrally-buoyant multi-functional robotic arm to inspect the surface and crawling tracks to traverse the seafloor. This multi-robot system was field tested, which proved its efficacy in inspecting oil and gas assets in shallow waters.},

	abstract = {The creation of a Marine Internet of Things platform, including the Underwater Internet of Things, is needed to ensure the interaction and digital navigation of heterogeneous marine robotic agents. It is necessary to combine the following robotic agents: autonomous underwater vehicles, remotely operated vehicles, active and passive marine sensors, buoys, underwater sonar stations, coastal communication posts, and other elements of the platform. To ensure the interaction of all these elements, it is necessary to use a common communication system within the platform, as well as a common navigation and control system to solve complex problems of the navigation and control of the movement of robotic agents in order to implement a joint mission to collect and transmit data, including video information in real time. The architecture of the Marine Internet of Things platform must first be defined in order to use a unified approach to data exchange. This article provides an overview of approaches to determining the architectures of network underwater and marine communication systems based on the concept of the Internet of Things. This paper provides a comprehensive study of {MIoT} applications, challenges, and architectures. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: we introduce potential {MIoT} applications; we point out the challenges of {MIoT} (i.e., the differences between {MIoT} and {IoT}); and we analyze the {MIoT} system architecture.},

	abstract = {The design of a remotely operated vehicle ({ROV}) with a size of 18.41 cm × 29.50 cm × 33.50 cm, and a weight of 15.64 kg, is introduced herein. The main goal is to capture underwater video by remote control communication in real time via Ethernet protocol. The {ROV} moves under the six brushless motors governed through a smart {PID} controller (Proportional + Integral + Derivative) and by using pulse-wide modulation with short pulses of 1 μs to improve the stability of the position in relation to the translational, ascent or descent, and rotational movements on three axes to capture images of 800 × 640 pixels on a video graphic array standard. The motion control, 3D position, temperature sensing, and video capture are performed at the same time, exploiting the four cores of the Raspberry Pi 3, using the threading library for parallel computing. In such a way, experimental results show that the video capture stage can process up to 42 frames per second on a Raspberry Pi 3. The remote control of the {ROV} is executed under a graphical user interface developed in Python, which is suitable for different operating systems, such as {GNU}/Linux, Windows, Android, and {OS} X. The proposed {ROV} can reach up to 100 m underwater, thus solving the issue of divers who can only reach 30 m depth. In addition, the proposed {ROV} can be useful in underwater applications such as surveillance, operations, maintenance, and measurement.},

	abstract = {Marine aquaculture is deeply rooted in Norwegian national economics and traditions, especially in the M⊘re og Romsdal region. This paper presents the development of a novel {ROV} for aquaculture inspection in marine application to provide first-hand information in fishery nets. The {ROV} is a part of so called “Sea Farm” project. When the {ROV} doesnot work, it will be carried by a floating platform. A winch on the platform could lift the {ROV} down to the sea water and lift it out of water after operation. The basic concept of this {ROV} is low-cost, built with off-shelf and easily manufactured components. There are three wings on the body part. One thruster is embedded into each wing to provide the propulsion. Based on the cooperation of three thrusters, the {ROV} has omnidirectional movement capability. A serial tests in the water tank were implemented including motion comparison, speed and turning tests to verify the concept and its propulsion mechanisms. In the end, conclusions and future work are given.},
